Hola, I'm Ricardo.

![Ricardo Profile](/static/ricardo_profile.jpeg#center)

<br />

Calm, curious, creative.

I ran an independent cinema ([**Cairo Cinema Café**](https://www.ricardoancona.com/posts/cairo-cinema/)) in México for almost 10 years.

Now I'm living in Berlin, where I'm building [**datadice**](https://datadice.io/), a Business Intelligence Agency.
And besides [**watching movies**](https://letterboxd.com/ricardoancona/list/one-per-year-1945-2021/), I'm planning on spending more time and attention making them.

In between México and Germany, I also lived and worked in China and Singapore (MSc in Supply Chain and Logistics, at NTU). Inspired by Kevin Kelly's Asia Grace, I made [**Asian Guacamole | Volume 1**](https://ricardoancona.pixieset.com/asianguacamole/).

Podcasts that feel like conversations with friends are one of my favorite things. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChQ0en3E1vE) is the last episode of my 7-year podcast with Maru (en español), [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1yxhN0Q18YG9dLgwi6YYbv) I am talking about living and working in China with my good friend Álvaro (en español) and [here](https://anchor.fm/the-datadice-podcast/) is an interview series that I made with the team of datadice (I think every company should make a staff podcast).

In the spirit of the CDs that I would *burn* with my favorite songs of that month when I was a teenager, I made a [**Life Mixtape**](https://www.ricardoancona.com/posts/life-mixtape/).

The family dog locked me out of the house once. We remained good friends.

I made this site using Hugo (still not sure how the tape is holding everything together).

I live with [**FSHD**](https://www.ricardoancona.com/posts/fshd/), a genetic progressive muscle degeneration disease, which, like Rabbi Haviva Ner-David says, has been one of my greatest teachers.
