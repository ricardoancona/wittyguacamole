Hola, I'm Ricardo.

![Ricardo Profile](/static/ricardo_profile.jpeg#center)


<br />

- Calm, curious, creative.

- I ran an independent cinema ([**Cairo Cinema Café**](https://www.ricardoancona.com/posts/cairo-cinema/)) in México for almost 10 years, until deciding to sell it in early 2018.

- I worked in Mexico, Singapore (MSc in Supply Chain and Logistics, at NTU), China, and now in Germany (Berlin).

- Now: I'm building [**datadice**](https://datadice.io/), a Business Intelligence Agency.

- I made this site using Hugo, still not sure how the tape is holding everything together.

- The family dog locked me out of the house once. We remained good friends.

- Bedwetter until I was around 12. I was a great guest at sleepovers.

- More: [**Life Mixtape**](https://www.ricardoancona.com/posts/life-mixtape/) and [**One Movie per Year**](https://letterboxd.com/ricardoancona/list/one-per-year-1945-2021/)
