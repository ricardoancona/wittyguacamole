The Press Box has been one of my favorite podcasts for a few years now.
At the end of (almost) every episode, Bryan and David play "David Shoemaker Guesses the Strained Pun Headline".
I've been keeping track of their "stats" since January 2021.

You could help by:
- Sending the article links to the Pun Headlines that don't have it.
- Making a game so that people can guess the strained pun headline.
- Making a supercut of only the strained pun headline section of each episode.
