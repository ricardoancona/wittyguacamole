For over seven years I made a podcast with Maru and Diego, Padrecito Empresarial. It pretended to be about business. It was more about life and the chance that running a business gives you to create your own world.

En espa√±ol.

All episodes are in a YouTube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxiB5_Ps6bA&list=PLQgaUUFabc2gtkvmzFW41myCeCfaAxQGw).

Maru keeps the spirit of the podcast going at
